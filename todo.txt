graphite is an in-browser graph editor with real-time collaborative editing.


The intended use is as a project planner.
The workload for any project is naturally representable as a directed acyclic graph, where nodes are tasks and edges are dependencies between tasks.
This is similar in spirit to a Gantt chart in project management, or the dataflow model of computation.

As such, there will be some specialized features geared toward this use case, for example:
	-mark nodes as complete or incomplete (or more generally mark their "status" as in scrum)
	-marking a node as complete with unsatisfied dependencies prompts an "are you sure" message
	-by default, raise a warning upon detecting a cycle
	-given a graph and a set of nodes which have been marked as complete, 
	output the list of tasks which have no unsatisfied dependencies.
	-A node can contain a link to a separate nested graph, which encodes the work required to complete the node's task
	once all dependencies have been satisfied.
	-Topologically sort the incomplete nodes in a graph to produce a project schedule

However, there is no reason not to make it a more general graph viewer & editor.
The following additional features are on the table:
	-specifics of node metadata
		-a "title panel" is a block of text of a small restricted length
		-a "content panel" is a block of formatted text of unrestricted length
		-each node and edge contains a title panel, which is always rendered
		-each node contains a content panel, which is rendered if clicked on or hovered over
	-graphs can export to / import from a variety of formats
		-JSON
		-adjacency list
		-other prominent graph formats
		-pencil & paper drawing (hence the name)
	-force-based layout sanitization
	-local navigation (focused on a node and its outgoing/incoming edges)
	-mundane editor features
		-backups
		-rectangle select (left click & drag to select only nodes, right click & drag to select both nodes and edges)
		-copy/paste/duplicate
		-nodes stretch to encapsulate their contents
		-search node contents with ctrl f
	-given a selected group of nodes, create a new node on which they all depend
	-given a selected group of nodes, create a new node which depends on all of them
